# Data Analysis

## Data Management

Always save your raw data in its original format.  The [TIER protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/) provides an example of how to work with raw and analyzed data.

{: .highlight }
Never write over your raw data with cleaned or analyzed data.

Using scripts to perform all your data analysis on (copied) raw data is the most reusable and reproducible method to analyze data.

## Project file organization

Consider specifying file organization (in addition to file naming) conventions. The [TIER protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/) may be a resource to consider for setting up project file structures.

Documentation that meets the specifications of the TIER Protocol contains all the data, scripts, and supporting information necessary to enable you, your instructor, or an interested third party to reproduce all the computations necessary to generate the results you present in the report you write about your project.
